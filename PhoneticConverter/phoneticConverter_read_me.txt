# Phonetic Spelling Number Converter

## Introduction

A component to a check writing machine that can convert any number up to six digits into the phonetic spelling of the total number amount, cents included.

## Code Samples

This program relies on several functions which break down the number into parts up to three digits long and then analyzes the numeric value to pinpoint it's exact phonetic match residing in a mixture of two arrays.

This program is heavy in if/else if statements.

## Installation

Code should be opened with a text editor, and the user input should be set as the value for the variable "numbers". Input is placed as a STRING format, with NO $ sign attached.

Number MUST have proper placement of commas to differentiate thousands from hundreds with proper cent value or a ".00" if there is no cent value.

The program will then log the proper phonetic spelling.

The code output can be seen through command prompt or on the developer tools of the blank HTML page provided.
